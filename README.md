# Weather Forecast App

A responsive web application for displaying weather forecasts with user action logging.

![Weather Forecast App](client/src/assets/FrontPage.png)

## Features

- Responsive layout for all device sizes
- Searchable dropdown to select cities for weather forecasts
- Per-user history with server-side logging (no reliance on localStorage for auth’d users)
- Weather analytics endpoints: hottest/coldest cities, top cities, recent views
- Alert rules with quiet hours, per-rule digest inclusion, daily digest scheduling, and manual “send digest now”
- Email notifications for alerts/digests (SMTP-configurable) with throttling to avoid provider rate limits
- Display of current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts (implementation shown below)
- JWT-based authentication with optional guest mode for quick previews

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React 18 with Vite
- Axios for API requests
- Tailwind CSS (as a PostCSS plugin) for utility-based styling

### Backend

- .NET 9 Web API
- Entity Framework Core + SQLite for persistence
- JWT authentication with DotNetEnv-driven configuration
- Background worker for alert evaluation + digest processing
- SMTP email delivery for alerts/digests (pluggable via env variables)

### APIs

- api.meteo.lt for weather data

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) for the React client
- npm or yarn
- .NET SDK 9.x for the API

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nojusta/weather-forecast-app
cd weather-forecast-app
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install

# Backend (restores NuGet packages)
cd ../server
dotnet restore
```

3. Create `.env` files:

- **Server (`server/.env`)** – JWT + database + optional SMTP configuration:

  ```ini
  JWT_SECRET_KEY=<Generate_jwt_token_and_add_here>
  CONNECTION_STRING=Data Source=weather-app.db

  # SMTP (required for alert emails/digests)
  SMTP_HOST=<smtp_host>
  SMTP_PORT=587
  SMTP_USER=<smtp_username>
  SMTP_PASS=<smtp_password>
  SMTP_FROM=noreply@weatheralerts.local
  ```

- **Client directory (`client/.env`)** – frontend API target:
  ```ini
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5053
  ```

⚠️ **These `.env` files are not included in the repository for security practices** but are required for the application to function properly. Make sure to create both files before starting the development servers.

4. Apply migrations and start the development servers

```bash
# Backend
cd server
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run

# Frontend (in a new terminal)
cd client
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. (Port may vary depending on your system).

💡 _To create a production build, use `npm run build`, and preview it with `npm run preview`._

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Stack

- **Vitest** (test runner)
- **React Testing Library** (component testing)
- **Jest DOM** (DOM matchers)
- **Axios & LocalStorage mocking** for isolated tests

### Component Tests

Tests that verify UI components render and behave correctly:

- **Layout Component**

  - Renders header with application title
  - Includes navigation structure
  - Correctly renders child components

- **CitySearch Component**

  - Filters cities based on user input
  - Displays loading state appropriately
  - Shows most viewed cities section
  - Handles empty search and selection events

- **CurrentWeather Component**

  - Displays location name and region
  - Shows temperature and "feels like" values
  - Renders weather conditions and metadata
  - Gracefully handles missing data

- **ForecastDisplay Component**
  - Renders exactly 5 days of forecast data
  - Groups forecasts correctly by day
  - Shows temperature and conditions for each day
  - Returns null when data is missing

### Service Tests

Tests that verify API communication and data handling:

- **Weather Service**

  - Handles API errors with proper error propagation
  - Manages empty or malformed API responses

- **Log Service**
  - Successfully logs city view events
  - Handles network failures without crashing

### Integration Tests

- **App Component**
  - Loads and stores most viewed cities in localStorage
  - Updates localStorage when a city is selected
  - Maintains a maximum of 3 most viewed cities

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Performance Optimization

A Lighthouse audit of the deployed application shows excellent performance metrics.
